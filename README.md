## üõ†Ô∏è METHODOLOGY & TOOLS USED
Platform: Microsoft Power BI
Techniques & Tools:

Power Query: For data cleaning, shaping, and joining multiple data sources.

DAX: For custom KPIs such as satisfaction rates, lead times, and route share.

Custom Visuals: Bar charts, map visuals, donut charts, and dynamic KPI cards.

UX/UI Enhancements: Soft color palette, tooltips, dynamic filters, and navigation tabs.

## üìà KEY FINDINGS & DASHBOARD INSIGHTS
Skincare Dominates Revenue

Skincare emerged as the most lucrative category, contributing ‚Çπ24.16L to a total revenue of ‚Çπ57.77L (over 41% share).

Product Volume Snapshot

A total of 46,099 units sold across all categories, indicating strong consumer demand.

Transport Efficiency

Roadways were the dominant transport mode, followed by seaways, indicating preference for speed over volume.

City-Level Revenue Trends

Mumbai ranked highest in total revenue, followed closely by Kolkata, while Delhi contributed the least.

Sales Volume by City

Kolkata led in units sold, suggesting higher volume at lower margins, unlike Mumbai‚Äôs high-value transactions.

Top Transit Route

Route A was responsible for over 43% of product movement, making it the backbone of current logistics.

Customer Satisfaction Challenges

The average satisfaction rate stood at 2.28, falling short of the 3.00 target‚Äîindicating the need for service or delivery improvements.

Delivery Performance

The average lead time was 14.77 days, pointing to opportunities for delivery process optimization.

## üí° RECOMMENDATIONS
Boost Performance in Low-Satisfaction Areas: Conduct root cause analysis on feedback scores and focus on underperforming regions.

Review Route A Efficiency: Despite its high usage, verify if Route A still offers the best cost-time trade-off.

Reduce Lead Times: Collaborate with logistics partners to shorten delivery windows or set clearer ETAs.

Balance Revenue vs Volume Focus: Investigate pricing strategies in Kolkata to potentially increase revenue per unit.

Enhance Stock Replenishment for Skincare: Given its high demand, maintain optimal reorder thresholds to avoid future stockouts.

## ‚úÖ CONCLUSION
This Power BI dashboard reveals critical insights into sales performance, logistics, and customer experience across the supply chain. It highlights both strengths‚Äîlike robust skincare sales and efficient road-based transport‚Äîand challenges, such as low satisfaction scores and delivery delays. With data-driven strategies, organizations can enhance supply reliability, customer trust, and operational efficiency.
